# Issues and Suggestions Tracking
This platform is intended for the purpose of tracking all development on Titan.TF, such as keeping known bugs on our radar and allowing players to ideate on new features and solutions.

It is also a public roadmap to let everyone see what's coming up and what we're working on.

## Bug Bounty
This is a pilot program set up to encourage more players to report bugs. Every bug reported and resolved will be rewarded with a bounty. This is a replacement for the [Fix Titan.TF](https://fix.titan.tf) platform.

#### Critical Security Exploits
DO NOT post such issues with great detail on this platform. Create an issue in high level detail containing little to no exposure of the bug and write an email to `myst@titan.tf` or [open a support ticket](https://titan.tf/support) with the full details including the steps to replicate it.


### Rewards
The bug classification is on a case by case basis.
